# Development Notes

## Running `make dev`

When running `make dev`, the process will often not terminate on its own but will display useful debugging information and error messages. Once you see an error or the information you need, feel free to terminate the process with Ctrl+C.

This is normal behavior for the Wails development server, which runs continuously to provide hot reloading and real-time error reporting.
